		"With this setting multiple characters might be replaced by the same letter, you can have 2 'A's for example",
		"This breaks all text in this game pretty amazingly. Might cause crashes, so use with caution!"
	},
	"Menu Setting Descriptions":
	{
		"Randomises all menu icons and some other things too. Can cause pretty whacky results",
		"With this setting a menu texture might appear in multiple places (Temporarily disabled, causes very frequent crashes)"

	"Block Setting Descriptions":
	{
		"If you think this game is too easy to play, turn this setting on. It will erase your muscle memory on levels. Potential seisure warning, this can get wild",
		"With this setting multiple blocks can look identical to make this even more confusing. Fun! (Temporarily disabled, causes very frequent crashes)"

	"Other Settings":
	{
		"Here are some settings that might be worth adjusting",
		"You can set a custom seed to get repeatable results. Setting it to 0 will give you a random seed",
