# What's New:
This application stating with version 2.0.x supports Geometry Dash 2.2

# Geometry-Dash-Randomiser
An application to mess with Geometry Dash's files

# With this app you can mess with game file in various ways.

- Do you want to Randomise on-screen text?
- Would you like to randomise every texture in the game to make navigating and playing damn near impossible?
- This application can do all that and more (in the future, maybe :) )
- Here is a video of what you can expect: [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/joB3ZjvAnq8) (This is with every setting enabled as of 1/Nov/2023)

# Download the app [here](https://github.com/Hydrough2k2k/Geometry-Dash-Randomiser/releases/tag/Geometry_Dash_Randomiser)

 - Alternatively click on Releases on the right side, and download the RAR from the most recent one

This application is fully compatible with Geometry Dash v2.203
- To start using it you will need to grab files from the Geometry Dash/Resources folder
- Put every file ending in .fnt and every file starting with GJ_GameSheet and ending with .plist into the "Original files" folder
- When the randomisation is done, copy the files from the Randomised file folder and paste into Geometry Dash/Resources
- Finally, launch the game and enjoy the chaos!
- To revert the files to the original ones you can copy the files from "Original Files". Those will never be altered, only read
