# Geometry-Dash-Randomiser
An application to mess with Geometry Dash's files

# With this app you can mess with the game in various ways.

- Do you want to Randomise on-screen text?
- Wanna have a ball for a wave and a portal for a ship?
- Would you like to randomise every texture in the game to make navigating and playing damn near impossible?
- This application can do all that and more (in the future, maybe :) )

# Download the app [here](https://github.com/Hydrough2k2k/Geometry-Dash-Randomiser/releases/tag/Geometry-Dash-Ransomiser)

This application is fully compatible with Geometry Dash v2.113
- To start using it you will need to grab files from the Geometry Dash/Resources folder
- Put every file ending in .fnt and every file starting with GJ_GameSheet into the "Original files" folder
- When the randomisation is done, copy the files from the Randomised file folder and paste into Geometry Dash/Resources
- Finally, launch the game and enjoy the chaos!
- To revert the files to the original ones you can copy the files from "Original Files". Those will never be altered, only read

# Compatibility:

- Windows 10 64 bit, Windows 11 64 bit
